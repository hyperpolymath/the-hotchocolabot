== Release Strategy

=== Versioning Scheme

- **0.x.x**: Pre-1.0 development, workshop testing phase
- **1.0.0**: First production-ready release (after competition submission)
- **1.x.x**: Feature additions, educational material updates
- **2.x.x**: Major architectural changes or breaking API changes

=== Version Increments

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes to configuration, API, or hardware requirements
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features, educational materials, non-breaking hardware additions
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor improvements

=== Release Process

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md** (move items from Unreleased to new version)
2. **Update version** in Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock
3. **Run tests**: `cargo test --all`
4. **Build release binary**: `cargo build --release`
5. **Cross-compile**: `cargo build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --release`
6. **Create git tag**: `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"`
7. **Push tag**: `git push origin v0.1.0`
8. **GitHub Actions** automatically creates release with binaries
9. **Announce** in discussions, social media, workshop venues

- [ ] Advanced educational modules (formal verification, TLA+)
- [ ] Alternative hardware guides (different pumps, sensors)
- [ ] Cost-reduced version (<£200)

=== v1.0.0 (Planned - Q3 2025)

- [ ] Competition submission complete
- [ ] 30+ students trained
- [ ] Impact data published

== Breaking Changes Policy

We take breaking changes seriously, especially for educational use:

1. **Deprecation Warning**: Feature marked deprecated in release N
2. **Migration Guide**: Provided in release N
3. **Grace Period**: At least one minor version (N+1)
4. **Removal**: Feature removed in release N+2 or next major version

Example:
- v0.5.0: Feature X deprecated, migration guide provided
- v0.6.0: Feature X still works but warns
- v0.7.0 or v1.0.0: Feature X removed

== Migration Guides

=== Upgrading from Pre-Release to v0.1.0

No migration needed - initial release.

=== Future Migrations

Will be documented here as breaking changes occur.
